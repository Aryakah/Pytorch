Tumor Classification with CNN


![Dt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922ee8cd-c56a-4869-a7e1-c7cd79519100)

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either containing tumors or being healthy.
Features

    Custom CNN Model: Built using PyTorch with convolutional and pooling layers.
    Image Processing: Reads and resizes images to a uniform size (128x128 pixels) using OpenCV.
    Training & Evaluation: Trains the model on a dataset of tumor and healthy images and evaluates its accuracy.
