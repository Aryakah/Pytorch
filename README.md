Tumor Classification with CNN

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either containing tumors or being healthy.
Features

    Custom CNN Model: Built using PyTorch with convolutional and pooling layers.
    Image Processing: Reads and resizes images to a uniform size (128x128 pixels) using OpenCV.
    Training & Evaluation: Trains the model on a dataset of tumor and healthy images and evaluates its accuracy.
